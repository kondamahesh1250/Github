<p><b>Ratan Naval Tata</b> (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman of <a href=' '>Tata Sons</a>.
 He was a chairman of the <a href=' '>Tata Group</a> from 1990 to 2012, and interim chairman from October 2016 through February 2017. 
He continues to head its charitable trusts.<sup>[2][3]</sup> In 2008, he received the <a href=' '>Padma Vibhushan</a>, the second highest civilian honour 
in India, after receiving the <a href=' '>Padma Bhushan</a>, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.<sup>[4]</sup>

<p>He is the son of <a href=' '>Naval Tata</a>, who was adopted by <a href=' '>Ratanji Tata</a> son of <a href=' '>Jamsetji Tata</a>, the founder of the <a href=' '>Tata Group</a>.
He graduated from the <a href=' '>Cornell University College of Architecture</a> with a bachelor's degree in architecture.<sup>[5]</sup> 
He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of <a href=' '>Tata Steel</a>. He later succeeded <a href=' '>J. R. D. Tata</a> as chairman of Tata Sons 
upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired <a href=' '>Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover</a>, and <a href=' '>Corus</a>, in an 
attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the 
world, having donated around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.</p>

<p>Ratan Tata is also a prolific investor and has made numerous investments in several startups. Tata has invested in over 30 
start-ups to date, most in a personal capacity and some via his investment company.<sup>[6][7]</sup></p>
